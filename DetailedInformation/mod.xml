	name="Creature Detailed Information"
	description="Show you more detailed information about creatures (including yourself).including health, resistance and protection

Hover the mouse over the creature to display brief health information, and Right click to display detailed information. If the panel blocks your view, you can double-click the right click to quickly turn this function on or off.

and, this idea was put forward by Veum on discord. I don't have his steam account yet, so I can't add him to the co authors for the time being."
